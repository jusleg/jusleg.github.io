{% textalign center %}
Introducing Appolo, a set of plugins and themes for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to create a static portfolio website for app developers to showcase their work. Its minimalistic theme and playful animations make it perfect to display the amazing apps you have made. The responsive design looks perfect in desktop or mobile. It also comes with a set of plugins to remove the hassle of formatting your apps' pages. The theme is based on a [Zoom Slider demo](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/07/06/zoom-slider/) in [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops).

{% section_title Adding A New App %}

To add a new app, simply create a markdown file in `_posts` directory or just duplicate the markdown file for this page in `_posts/2015-12-26-appolo.markdown`. Set the variables in the YAML Front Matter block with your app's parameters.

{% table %}
layout >> Always use `post`.
title >> `title` appears on the top of the app's page.
subtitle >> `subtitle` appears after the `title` in the app's page.
description >> Used in the head's meta.
date >> Published date.
categories >> Not used currently.
permalink >> NEEDED. This sets the app's URL to baseurl/permalink.  
device >> Type of device to use for this app in the landing page. Available options: imac, macbook, iphone, ipad, and apple-watch.

{% section_title Writing an App Page %}

Appolo comes with some custom [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) tags to make it easy writing an app page.

{% table %}
`{ % section_title Section Title Here %}` >> Use this tag to render a section title.
`{ % img alignment | relative_path_to_image | alt %}` >> Use `img` tag to render an image with an assigned `alignment`. You can use one of the four alignments: `center`, `right`, `left`, or `fill-width`.
`{ % textalign center %}` >> Use `textalign` block to set the paragraph alignment.
`{ % youtube youtube_id %}` >> Use `youtube` followed by the id of the video to show a responsive YouTube frame.
`{ % features %}` >> Use `features` block to list the features of your apps.
`{ % download type | url %}` >> Use `download` tag to render a button to download your app. Available options for `type` are `app_store`, `play_store`, `direct`, and `coming_soon`.
{% endtable %}

{% section_title App's Images %}

When adding a new app, there are some images you need to prepare. You need to put these images in `images/app_name` folder.
