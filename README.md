Its minimalistic theme and playful animations make it perfect to display the amazing apps you have made. The responsive design looks perfect in desktop or mobile. It also comes with a set of plugins to remove the hassle of formatting your apps' pages.

Made by a developer. For developers.

There are so many single page landing page for showcasing a single app. But I need a theme to showcase multiple apps and I couldn't find it. And since I've been using Github with Jekyll and Octopress to blog, I figured it'd be nice to have a Jekyll them for apps showcase. This theme is based on a [Zoom Slider demo](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/07/06/zoom-slider/) in [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops). Appolo also comes with custom [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) tags to help writing an app's page easier. Check out my [apps' website](http://www.delightfuldev.com) to see it in action.

Quick start

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install Jekyll if you haven't. `gem install jekyll`
3. Go to repo's directory and run `jekyll serve` from Terminal.

Adding a new app
--

To add a new app, simply create a markdown file in `_posts` directory or just duplicate sample the markdown file in `_posts/2015-12-26-appolo.markdown`. Set the variables in the YAML Front Matter block with your app's parameters.

Key | Description
------------- | -------------
layout | Always use `post`.
title | `title` appears on the top of the app's page.
subtitle | `subtitle` appears after the `title` in the app's page.
description | Used in the head's meta.
date | Published date.
categories | Not used currently.
permalink | NEEDED. This sets the app's URL to baseurl/permalink.  
device | Type of device to use for this app in the landing page. Available options: imac, macbook, iphone, ipad, and apple-watch.
name | Name of the app that is shown on the landing page.
tagline | Shown under `name` on the landing page.
external_url | OPTIONAL. If you want to open external URL when user clicks on the app, set this variable.

Writing a new app page

Appolo comes with some custom [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) tags to make it easy writing an app page.

Tag | Description
------------- | -------------
`{% section_title Section Title Here %}` | Use this tag to render a section title.
<code>{% img alignment &#124; relative_path_to_image &#124; alt %}</code> | Use `img` tag to render an image with an assigned `alignment`. You can use one of the four alignments: `center`, `right`, `left`, or `fill-width`.
